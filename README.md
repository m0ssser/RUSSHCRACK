## _RUSSHCRACK üê±‚Äçüë§_

**RUSSHCRACK** is a multi-threaded SSH brute-force tool written in Rust. It attempts to brute-force SSH login credentials using usernames and passwords from provided wordlists. The tool leverages the `ssh2` crate to handle SSH connections and supports custom configurations for threads, timeouts, and target hosts.

> **Features**

‚Ä¢ Multi-threaded brute-forcing for fast credential testing.

‚Ä¢ Customizable SSH target IP, port, username, and password wordlists.

‚Ä¢ Colored output for better visibility of successful, failed, or connection errors.

‚Ä¢ User-friendly command-line interface.

## Prerequisites üìã

> Before using **RUSSHCRACK**, ensure you have the following:

‚Ä¢ Rust installed on your system.

‚Ä¢ Valid wordlists for usernames and passwords with read and write permission (use `chmod 644 file_name.txt` to set file permissions).

‚Ä¢ Install necessary dependencies by adding them to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
ssh2 = "0.9.1"
colored = "2.0"
```

## Installation üíæ

Clone the repository from GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/m0ssser/RUSSHCRACK.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd RUSSHCRACK
```

Build the project:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

The compiled binary will be available in the `target/release/` directory.

## Usage üöÄ

Run the binary or use `cargo run` to execute:

```bash
cargo run
```

You'll be prompted for:

- **Target IP address**: Enter the SSH server's IP address.
- **Target Port**: Specify the port (default is `22`).
- **Username Wordlist**: Path to the username wordlist file.
- **Password Wordlist**: Path to the password wordlist file.

> **Example**:

```bash
Enter target IP address: 192.168.1.100
Enter target port (default 22): 22
Enter path to username wordlist: ./usernames.txt
Enter path to password wordlist: ./passwords.txt
[+] Starting Bruteforce...
```

Successful attempts will be shown in **green**, and failures in **red**.
